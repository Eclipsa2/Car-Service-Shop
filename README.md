In this OOP app I have used the following design patterns:
  1. Singleton for reading and writing in the project files - in main.cpp
  2. Decorator pattern when there is an exotic car/motorcycle - in ValoareVehicul.h file
  3. Prototype pattern if the car/motorcycle is from the police - in main.cpp
  4. Factory pattern - I use it to create new cars and new motorcycles - in main.cpp
